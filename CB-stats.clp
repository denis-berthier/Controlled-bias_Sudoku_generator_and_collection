;;; This file gives the SudoRules commands for reproducing the computations
;;; for the correlation and controlled-bias results published in [PBCS].
;;; It also gives these results, plus new ones obtained after [PBCS3].

;;; The Controlled_bias_Sudoku_generator_and_collection is supposed to be
;;; installed in the same CSP-Rules directory as CSP-Rules-V2.1.

;;; WARNING for people with little background in statistcs:
;;; as any statistical results, those below rely on the distributions under discussion,
;;; i.e. the controlled-bias and unbiased ones.
;;; Obviously, they cannot be extended to other distributions such as:
;;; - puzzles with large number of clues (or candidates);
;;; - the hardest puzzles;
;;; - puzzles with some particular pattern (be it of cells for the clues or of candidates);
;;; - puzzles in T&E(2) or T&E(3).
;;; Any such collection has weight close to 0 in the unbiased statistics.
;;; Similarly, any collection produced by a simple bottom-up or top-down generator will have a different distribution (see file "comparisons.pdf" in the DOCS folder.



;;; Before running the following computations,
;;; do not forget to assemble all the GLOBAL collections from the SMALL ones,
;;; by running the Unix scripts in the "assemble-XXX.clp" files.
;;; Note that the results given below are the raw output of SudoRules
;;; and that the precision of the results should be reduced manually to a reasonable number of digits.

;;; If you want to use the following functions without change to re-run the following computations for yourself,
;;; the present repository should be renamed "CBGC" and moved to the CSP-Rules directory,
;;; which should look as follows, if you have installed all the repositories of the [CSP-Rules] family:
;;;
;;;          /CBGC
;;;          /Classifications-of-TE2-Sudokus
;;;          /Classifications-of-TE3-Sudokus
;;; CSP-Rules/CSP-Rules-V2.1
;;;          /CSP-Rules-Examples
;;;          /Sudoku_Hierachical_Classifier

;;; To use the statistical functions below, you need to load SudoRules
;;; (but you don't need to have any rules activated).
;;; Then, you will have the CSP-Rules folder already defined in the configuration file by:
;;; (defglobal ?*CSP-Rules* = <your path to the folder before CSP-Rules> "/CSP-Rules/")

;;; You now need only to define the CBGC folder:
(defglobal ?*CBGC* = (str-cat ?*CSP-Rules* "CBGC/"))

;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;; As a result of the definitions of whips and braids
;;; and of the confluence property of the Bn resolution theories, W is always â‰¥ B.
;;; The following results show that the W and B ratings are very rarely different
;;; (in only 0.26% of the controlled-bias puzzles).
;;; Moreover, when they are different:
;;; - it's very rarely by more than 1 (in only 0.011% of the controlled-bias puzzles).
;;; - it's extremely rarely by more than 2 (in only 0.00066%, i.e. 6.6 in one million, of the controlled-bias puzzles).

;;; This is what I have called long ago "THE MIRACLE OF WHIPS":
;;; although they are structurally and computationally much simpler than braids
;;; ("exponentially" simpler wrt length),
;;; they give "almost always" the same results.

The distributions are the same at the first 5 levels (i.e. upto W/B = 4). As expected, they diverge all the more as W,B increase (the larger B, the more chances of having W > B). However, the differences remain small.

For all the gB values computed by CSP-Rules (i.e. cbg-000), they coincide with the SHC1 ones.
So, we use SHC1 below.
